  <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
  <p><strong>Yearli &amp; Google Calendar API</strong></p>

  <p>These terms apply to your use of the Yearli app and its use of the Google Calendar API. By using Yearli with a connected Google account, you agree to these terms and to the applicable Google terms referenced below.</p>

  <h2>Google's Terms</h2>
  <p>Yearli uses Google's Calendar API to display your calendar events in an annual view. Use of the Google Calendar API is governed by <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google APIs Terms of Service</a> and the relevant <a href="https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/guides/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Calendar API</a> documentation. Where anything in these Terms of Use conflicts with Google's terms, Google's terms apply to the use of the API.</p>

  <h2>How Yearli Uses the Google Calendar API</h2>
  <p>Yearli requests read-only access to your Google Calendar data solely to show your events in the app's annual overview. Calendar data is not shared with third parties by the developer. Processing takes place on your device and via Google's services in accordance with <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's Privacy Policy</a>. Yearli also complies with the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google API Services User Data Policy</a> where it applies to access to user data.</p>

  <h2>Consent and Data Transfer</h2>
  <p>By connecting your Google account to Yearli, you consent to the transfer and processing of data (including to the United States or other countries where Google or its affiliates operate) as required for the API to function. Such processing is subject to Google's privacy policy and applicable law.</p>

  <h2>Your Obligations</h2>
  <p>You will use Yearli and the Google Calendar API in compliance with applicable laws and with Google's terms. You will not use the app or the API for any unlawful purpose or in any way that violates the rights of others.</p>

  <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>Google provides its APIs "as is." To the extent Yearli relies on the Google Calendar API, availability and performance depend on Google's services. Liability limitations set out in the Google APIs Terms of Service apply to the use of the API.</p>
