  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>This app is developed and operated by <strong>Felix Haag</strong>. Only the data necessary for the operation of the app is processed. The developer has no access to any personal user content.</p>

  <h2>Data Processing</h2>
  <p>The app <em>Yearli</em> displays a customizable annual view of your calendar events. Calendar data is read from Apple Calendar (via the device) and, if you connect your account, from Google Calendar via the Google Calendar API. All processing of calendar content happens on your device or through Google's services; the developer does not store or share any of your calendar data.</p>

  <h2>Analytics and Usage Data</h2>
  <p>The app does not use any tracking or profiling tools. Only anonymized analytics are collected: aggregated usage statistics provided by Apple through App Store Connect (such as installation numbers or crash reports), as well as anonymous usage analytics processed by <a href="https://posthog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PostHog</a>. PostHog collects anonymized or pseudonymized data (such as an anonymized identifier) to understand how the app is used. None of this data contains personally identifiable information. For more on PostHog's practices, see <a href="https://posthog.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PostHog's privacy policy</a>.</p>

  <h2>Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
  <p>Subscriptions and in-app purchases are managed by <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RevenueCat</a>. RevenueCat processes anonymized transaction data, such as purchase date and subscription status, to verify active subscription access. No personal user data (such as names, email addresses, or payment details) is shared with the developer.</p>

  <h2>Legal Basis</h2>
  <p>The processing of data is based on Article 6 (1) (b) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (performance of a contract) and Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR (legitimate interest in providing a secure and functional app).</p>
